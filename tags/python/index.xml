      <description>In our previous articles we discussed about re-using Browser session in Selenium for local browsers. We spoke about saving the Session ID and the Executor URL for re-creating the sessions. Now let&amp;rsquo;s us have re-look at the approach when we use Selenium Grid
Launching the Grid I am using brew to install selenium-server-standalone on my Mac. But if you are using something else, then download the latest version from here</description>

      <description>This is another article in our &amp;ldquo;Re-use selenium session&amp;rdquo; series. This article is specific to Firefox browser ran on a local system using Selenium
Consider the below python code
from selenium import webdriver driver = webdriver.Firefox()  This opens up a firefox browser on your machine. We know that Selenium uses geckodriver for communicating with the firefox. So let&amp;rsquo;s check the process
$ ps aux | grep geckodriver tarun.lalwani 11982 0.</description>

      <description>A10 Networks provides hardware Load Balancer, which can be used to balance loads in your data center.
A10 Load Balancer (LB) have a web based interface to perform different task. Once the server definitions tasks are created, the common thing is to disable and enable servers out of LB.
Going to the web interface and performing these activities is a tedious task. Also many time the Linux operations teams want to view the status of these server.</description>

      <title>Why delayed output for python process in my Docker logs?</title>
      <link>http://tarunlalwani.com/post/why-delayed-output-python-docker/</link>

      <description>Recently while moving one of our projects to Docker, we had a weird error that our python script would not output any data in docker logs. We thought the scripts were stuck, but later we realized the logs had a delayed output
When we were running the script inside the docker image through bash they would give all output on the console fine. Which kind of puzzled us
So we created a simple project to recreate the issue</description>

      <description>Sometimes its required for us to be able to communicate with a remote host using automation. To do it in bash we can use the expect command. But do it in Python, we can use a package named paramiko.
Installing Paramiko Installation is quite simple. It can be done using the pip or pip3 command
$ pip install paramiko   Note: based on your setup, you might need to use sudo as well before the pip command</description>

      <description>Comparison between Selenium and UFT Behavior For those of us who come from a QTP/UFT background, being able to test the same browser after a disconnect is usually a piece of cake
1. systemutil.run &amp;quot;iexplore.exe&amp;quot; 2. x = 2/0 3. Browser(&amp;quot;index:=0&amp;quot;).navigate (&amp;quot;http://www.google.com&amp;quot;)  If we run the above script in QTP/UFT, the script will error out on Line #2 and we can re-run the script from Line #3 and it would still work and navigate inside the browser we had opened earlier.</description>
