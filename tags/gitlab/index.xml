      <description>Gitlab is an amazing Git hosting service. With it&amp;rsquo;s community edition, one can setup an in-house git server in no time.
Those who have been an earlier follower of Gitlab, may still be stuck with the version 6.X. Version 6.X was setup manually by creating DB in MySQL/Postgres, Nginx/Apache entries and few other setup steps.
As time moved on, Gitlab started providing packages and one could install or upgrade Gitlab using a package manager like yum, apt.</description>
