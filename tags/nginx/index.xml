      <description>Consider the following nginx config blocks
location / { proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080; }  and
location / { proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080/; }  They are both same in terms of final result. You if call /abc/def on the main server it passes the request to http://127.0.0.1:8080/abc/def
But as soon as you have a location block with a non-root path like below
location /app { proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080; }  The above config is not same as below</description>

      <description>I love Nginx for its revery proxy capabilities and ease of configuration. A simple proxy_pass can allow you to connect to any of the backends GoLang, php-fpm, NodeJS, another nginx, tomcat, apache, gunicorn, uwsgi, flask, django, a external CDN and many more
When proxying a request to another server, you may or may not have access to log of the server. So it is important to be able to debug, where the problem lies when an issue occurs.</description>

      <description>In one of our projects we wanted to capture and document incoming traffic to our server. The requirements for recording/capturing the incoming traffic were as below
 Capture both GET and POST requests Capture only certain locations Back-end service involved were PHP, Java and some NodeJS also Capture Response Code, Response Text and Duration also Mask certain sensitive data like emails, credit card numbers  The plan was to use this data for creating simulated production replay and make sure any changes made to code doesn&amp;rsquo;t impact existing working flows.</description>
