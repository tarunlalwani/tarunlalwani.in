      <description>Recently while moving one of our projects to Docker, we had a weird error that our python script would not output any data in docker logs. We thought the scripts were stuck, but later we realized the logs had a delayed output
When we were running the script inside the docker image through bash they would give all output on the console fine. Which kind of puzzled us
So we created a simple project to recreate the issue</description>
