      <description>SSL certificates allow us to secure communication between the server and user. Unfortunately SSL certificates are a bit costly and are not prefered to be bought for development environments. This is where self-signed certificates come into picture.
Creating a Self-signed certificate We can create a self-signed certificate using the openssl command
$ openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout selfsigned.key -out selfsigned.crt Generating a 2048 bit RSA private key .</description>
